**Welcome! You've reached the personal website of Koko Alberti.** I am a geographer with a keen interest in geoinformatics, web mapping, and remote sensing.

This website contains technical notes and articles on other things that spark my interest.

Currently I am working on [satellite-based index insurance](https://www.ears.nl/) and on getting [Geofolio](https://geofolio.org/) off the ground. Geofolio is a non-profit that aims to make the world's environmental data accessible and understandable for everyone. Have a look and let me know what you think.
