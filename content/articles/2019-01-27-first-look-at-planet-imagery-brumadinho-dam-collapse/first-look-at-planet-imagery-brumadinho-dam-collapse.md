This weekend news hit of a tailings dam collapse at a mine owned by Vale in Brumadinho, Brazil. From the initial reports and photos coming out of the area the damage looked immense. 

Because news reports were sparse on geospatial details that show the extent of the disaster, I started looking around for some data and put together this before/after visualization based on imagery by <a href="https://planet.com">Planet</a>.

The extent of the affected area looks to cover around 240 hectares (2.4sq.km), and the flood has destroyed large swaths of infrastructure in its path, including buildings, bridges, roads, and a smaller reservoir nestled in the valley downstream. Here are the before and after images:

<p>You can download the <a href="brumadinho_damage_extent.zip">shapefile for the damage extent</a> here (7Kb). It's in UTM Zone 22. For access to the satellite imagery it is probably best to contact the people at <a href="https://planet.com">Planet</a> directly.</p>

<p>There is also a <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/comcbhvelhas/barragens-de-mineracaovale">presentation from Vale</a> online with more details (photos, statistics, risk classifications) on this and other tailings dams in the surrounding area.</p>
