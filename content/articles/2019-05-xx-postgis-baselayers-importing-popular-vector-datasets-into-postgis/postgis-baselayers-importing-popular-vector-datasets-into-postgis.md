[PostGIS Baselayers](https://github.com/kokoalberti/postgis-baselayers) is a web application which downloads and imports popular vector datasets (Natural Earth, GADM, Geonames, etc) into a PostGIS database with the click of a button. It comes bundled with a Docker environment and a PostGIS database container to get up and running quickly. 

This post will explain in a bit more detail how it works and what you can do with it.
